# Face_Detection_1
In this project I create a face detection app for detecting the soccer players faces in images. 

## Technical requirements
For this analysis you need to have python installed and have the following libraries:
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

# Data
The data is stored in the images.rar file.

## Run the code
To run the code, you can use the file ```Code.py```.
